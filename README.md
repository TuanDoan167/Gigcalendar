# Gigcalendar
 *      Acts as a simple gig calendar with n commands:
 * ARTISTS - Prints all known artist names
 * ARTIST <artist name> - Prints single artist's gigs
 * STAGES - Prints all known stage names and their locations
 * STAGE <stage name> - Prints all artists having a gig at the given stage
 * ADD_ARTIST <artist name> - Adds a new artist
 * ADD_GIG <artist name> <date> <town name> <stage name> - Adds a new gig for
 * an artist with the given date, town, and stage (the artist can't already
 * have a gig on the same date and there can't be other gigs at the same stage
 * at the same time)
 * CANCEL <artist name> <date> - Cancels artist's gigs after the given date
 *
 *      The data file's lines should be in format
 * artist_name;date;town_name;stage_name.
 * Otherwise the program execution terminates instantly (but still gracefully).
